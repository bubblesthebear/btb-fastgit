Interactive Task Manager (came installed on Pi but might have to install on other distros) 
    htop

Manage running processes 

    Lists all processes running on the system 
        ps -A 
        Make it scrollable (q to quit) 
            ps -A | less 
        Searchable 
            ps -A | grep firefox


    Lists all processes in a tree format 
        pstree

    Kill a process
        kill PID 
        kill firefox 

    Searches for process name and returns process ID (PID) 
        pgrep firefox 

    Searches for Firefox's PID then kills the process in one line 
        kill $(pgrep firefox) 


    Kills a process when given a name 
        pkill firefox 
        killall firefox 

    Kills a GUI process by turning your cursor into an 'x' and letting you select the window process to kill. Exit by right-clicking. You can bind it to a hotkey for fast GUI process ending. 
        Xkill 


System

    Get info on a specific command
        info ~command~

    Get manual on a specific command (usually overkill as it's way more detailed)
        man ~command~

    Start, stop, or restart a system service
        sudo service ~service~ start
        sudo service ~service~ stop
        sudo service ~service~ restart

File Management

    Shows disk usage of specific directories. Was useful for when root on the Raspberry Pi 3B was filled and I had to figure out why. This showed me it was the root trash location. 
        du -h /home
            Human-readable output 
        du -h -d 2 /home/
            Human-readable output at depth of 2 subdirectories.

    Shows total space and free space left of detected file systems. Looks like what you'd expect from a disk usage tool.
        df
        df -h
