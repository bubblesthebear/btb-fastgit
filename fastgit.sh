# This is a script I made to learn more about Bash scripting and because I forgot git commands.  It also is a good example though of how I feel I created a quick script ALONG WITH a quick debug process to figure out if it worked or not without actually making any changes since those weren't required when I was simply testing whether passing a variable to a function would work, not whether or not the command would work.  I also like the formatting of echo and the spacing of the if and else
